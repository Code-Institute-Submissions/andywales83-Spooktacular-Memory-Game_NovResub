## Project Description

Spookacular Memory Game is a halloween themed memory card game, based on the classic card matching games. The game has been created, with the aim of allowing individuals a little lighthearted fun.

The game is based on a deck of 12 cards, which are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face over on each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards in the quickest time, in order to achieve the highest rating.
